# Stats_Comm_Process_Exploration
An exercise on expanding my Python skills while focusing on clear communication and statistics principles. 

## About This Project
This project was a final project for my Intro to Python course (ECON 6118 at Marquette University). I found a dataset on Kaggle that seemed interesting from a process standpoint, so I dove into the topic. Although I went above and beyond the project requirements, I had fun with this exercise. This was a great way to advance my Python skills, hone my communication abilities, and (try my best to) recall my statistics courses from undergraduate studies. 

### Dataset
**Iron Ore Refining using Flotation**
